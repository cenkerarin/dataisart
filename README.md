# Hands-Free Data Science

Interact with datasets using your **hands and voice** — no code, no clicks.  
This project lets you explore and visualize datasets (like Kaggle CSVs) through **hand gestures and natural language commands**, powered by **Computer Vision** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Modern data science tools are powerful, but often require heavy coding and technical expertise.  
**Hands-Free Data Science** aims to revolutionize the way we interact with data by enabling:

- ✅ Gesture-based data selection  
- ✅ Voice-controlled data analysis  
- ✅ AI-assisted visualizations  
- ✅ Zero coding, intuitive UX
